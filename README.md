# Library_DB
This is a project is an assignment for the Database course.
The idea is to create a database of my existing books that I have at home, to then be able to keep track of them via a graphical application.
To finished in time, the application will first only categorize the children's books I have at home. The database will be built using MYSQL and will maintain the standard of the third normalization form.
